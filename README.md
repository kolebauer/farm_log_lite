# Overview

Farm Log Lite is a simple mobile app that helps me practice using Flutter for real-world data collection.  
This app lets a user add farm log entries with details like the field name, crop, activity, and date.  
All logs are saved locally on the device using SQLite, so they stay even if the app is closed.

The purpose of this app is to build my experience with multi-screen navigation, local databases, and user input handling in Flutter.
